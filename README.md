# Sentiment-Analysis-Visualization-Classification-Summarized-News-Articles
The repository consists of python code which will perform sentiment analysis on summarized news articles. The code also supports visualization of sentiment information. The classification of news article sentiment is also given.

### News Article Summarization

The news articles are summarized into brief representation using the python program textSummarizationForNewsArticle_1.py. The precise brief representation of news article help user to understand its content quickly. The following figure shows an example of news article summarization.

### 3D Visualization of News Sentiment

The news article are subjected to sentiment analysis and collected various sentiment information such as positive, negative and compound score. Also number of positive,negative, neutral words are gathered from a news article. The program 3DSentiVisualizationsNews_2.py provides 3D visualization of sentiment information.

The summarization is performed in steps of 0 to 100 summarization ratio and each time sentiment scores are computed. The python program is given in 3DSentiVisualizeAfterSummary_4.py. The following figures are 3D visualizations generated after summarization.
